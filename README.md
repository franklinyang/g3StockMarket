=============

Linear regression: Feed Hao's algorithm the stock price history for each stock, and he will give us a list of linear regression coefficients for each stock.

1) What will the price be next round
- forecasting the error term
- applying regression
2) Should we buy, sell, or hold
- Function of the SVM
3) How many
- Sell all, buy all.
- In a world where everyone is playing exactly the same strategy, how do we deviate to do better?
